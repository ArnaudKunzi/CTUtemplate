# `CTUtemplate` <img src='man/figures/sticker.png' align="right" height="200">

`CTUtemplate` is a package to create a template directory structure (and files) and also includes the CTUs annual safety report function.



## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("CTU-Bern/CTUtemplate")
```


This may require `Sys.setenv(R_REMOTES_NO_ERRORS_FROM_WARNINGS="true")` if packages were built under a different R version to the one you are using.

## Usage

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(CTUtemplate)
```


### Template director structure

Once installed, in RStudio, open a "new project in a new directory" and select "CTU project template". Options in the following window are used to create the folders and headers of R (and eventually STATA) files.


### Annual safety report

THIS FUNCTION WILL BE REMOVED FROM THIS PACKAGE IN THE NEAR FUTURE. PLEASE USE THE [SwissASR](https://github.com/CTU-Bern/SwissASR) PACKAGE INSTEAD.

The `asr` function is used to fill out the Swiss Ethics Annual Safety Report template. It is intended that by passing a dataframe with the relevant information, plus a few other values, filling the template can be automated.

Assuming that all data variables are consistent with the defaults, the following might be used to fill out the report.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
asr(dataframe,
    trial_title = "Trial Name",
    protocol_number = "1",
    basec_number = "2153153",
    snctp_number = "3516135468",
    swissmedic_number = "kuis16153613",
    ec_name = "KEK Bern",
    product_name = "Drug name",
    sponsor_contact = "Mr Foo, University of Foo, Bar", 
    inst_name_address = "Mr Bar, University of Foo, Bar",
    n_centers_t = length(unique(alldata$site)),      # total number of sites
    n_centers_p = 15,                                # number of planned sites
    n_centers_c = length(unique(closedsites$site)),  # number of closed sites
    n_centers_o = length(unique(alldata$site)),      # number of open sites
    n_pat_t = 1000,                                  # total number of participants
    n_pat_e = length(unique(alldata$record_id)),     # enrolled participants
    n_pat_c = sum(all_data$eos_complete),            # complete participants
    n_pat_p = sum(all_data$eos_terminated),          # prematurely terminated participants
    period_from = min(dataframe$ic_date),            # assuming that the variable exists!
    period_to = Sys.Date()
    )
```


### UNIBE Red

There is also a function for the UNIBEs shade of red:

```{r, fig.height=1, fig.width=4, fig.align='center'}
par(mai = c(.5, .1, .1, .1), tck = -.01, mgp = c(1,.2,0))
plot(
  # main point:
  col = unibeRed(alpha = seq(.2, 1, .2)), 
  # other stuff for the figure
  x = seq(.2, 1, .2), y = rep(1,5), 
  pch = 15, cex = 5, xlab = "alpha", ylab = "", 
  yaxt = "n")
```


### Report templates

`CTUtemplate` has an Rmd template for sample size reports and a more generic template
with some examples of how to do things. 

|Function                   |Description
|:--------------------------|:---------------------------------------
|`use_report_template`      |Opens a generic file with various examples
|`use_ssreport_template`    |Opens a template for a sample size report 
|`use_recreport_template`   |Opens a template for a recruitment report
|`use_param_report_template`|Opens template files for using parameterized reports
|`use_ub_tex_template`      |Opens the UNIBE tex template allowing modifications for additional features of latex

The functions 
are used to open a new template in the location designated (the recommended location
would probably be `08_Reports_projnum`).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# for a sample size report
use_ssreport_template("folder/ssreport.Rmd")
# for the examples
use_report_template("folder/report.Rmd")
# for a template recruitment report
use_recreport_template("folder/recreport.Rmd")
# for an example of a parameterized report (note the lack of file extension here)
use_param_report_template("folder/param_report")
```

If modifications to the latex template are desired, it can be copied to the folder via

```{r, eval = FALSE}
use_ub_tex_template("folder/report.tex")
```

The YAML header in the Rmd file then needs to be changed to include

```
output: 
  CTUtemplate::report_pdf:
    report_template: "report.tex"
```

Using this approach, other latex packages can be used to extend the capabilities of latex.
