# package to create template directory structure (and files)


# installation

`remotes::install_github("aghaynes/CTUtemplate")`

This may require `Sys.setenv(R_REMOTES_NO_ERRORS_FROM_WARNINGS="true")` if packages were built under a different R version to the one you are using.

# usage

Once installed, in RStudio, open a "new project in a new directory" and select "CTU project template". Options in the following window are used to create the folders and headers of R (and eventually STATA) files.
