# 'ordinary' Rmd files would have this specified in the yaml header, but that 
#   doesnt work with the LaTeX template... hence, an additional file needs to be

```

\chapter{Latex syntax can be used}

It is in fact the easiest (only?) way to get chapters...

Otherwise, document sections, subsections etc can be created using Rmd syntax

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# section
## subsection
### subsubsection
```

# section

## subsection

### subsubsection

# Unnumbered Sections {-}

Use '{-}' to signify that a section should not be numbered.

\chapter{Tables}

Tables can be created via multiple approaches. Short tables that can be edited by hand can be written in Markdown

```{r, eval = FALSE}

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

```

btabler is another option. Here, you should use 'results='asis'' in the chunk option

```{r, results='asis'}
# remotes::install_github("CTU-Bern/btabler")
library(btabler)
df <- data.frame(name = c("", "Row 1", "Row2"),
                 out_t = c("Total", "t1", "t1"),
                 out_1 = c("Group 1", "g11", "g12"), 
                 out_2 = c("Group 2", "g21", "g22"))
btable(df, nhead = 1, nfoot = 0, caption = "Table1")
```

other popular options are `xtable` and `knitr::kable`.

# R Markdown {-}

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

# Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
